![preview.png](src/main/resources/preview.png)

This mod adds two powerful and exciting mounts to Necesse, allowing you to explore the world in new and exciting ways:

**The Swift Bat:**
* Fly above the terrain, soaring over water and trees.
* Enjoy a travel distance buff for faster exploration.
* Gain night vision during the nighttime for enhanced visibility.

**The Mighty Spider:**
* Ride through the caves with a fearsome arachnid companion.
* Gain +10 additional spider summons when using your Spider Staff.
* *These summons disappear when you dismount or use another summon item.*

**How to Obtain Your Mounts:**

* **Brave the Challenge:** Defeating Evil Protector and the Spider Queen will give you a chance to find the corresponding mount as loot.
* **Seek the Merchant's Treasures:** After defeating these bosses once, your friendly traveling merchant may have the mounts for sale.

***This mod is a remake of the original ["Mount Pack"](https://github.com/creativemindpie/mountpack) mod, which has been fixed, updated and improved for compatibility with the latest version of Necesse.***
